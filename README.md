## Synopsis

*sintl* is a tool for translating HTML5 web pages.  It's designed with
simplicity in mind; so for more complex needs, you may want to stick
with [itstool](http://itstool.org/) or other tools.

See the [sintl](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/sintl) website for stable
releases and documentation.

This is a read-only copy of the internal CVS repository and is kept
more-or-less up to date with current development.  If you have patches
or questions, however, you can still post them here or use the usual
GitHub facilities to submit patches.

## Installation

Download the latest version's 
[source archive](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/sintl/snapshots/sintl.tar.gz) 
(or download the project from GitHub), run `./configure`,
compile with `make`, then `sudo make install` (or `doas make install`,
whatever the case may be).

## License

All sources use the ISC (like OpenBSD) license.
